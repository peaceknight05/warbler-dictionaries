# Warbler Theory

My personal stenography dictionaries for use with Plover CAT software. Based off of Lapwing Theory and fully backward-compatible with Lapwing rules with a few additional rules for briefs sprinkled on top of it. Adds a large amount of British pronunciations and certain spelling variants not included in `lapwing-uk-additions`.

## Additions

- British (or more broadly non-North-American) pronunciations and some spellings
- Addition of certain rules from Philadelphia Clinic Theory (FR as m, S/KP for ex-, etc.)
- Exhaustive theory list on [this google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LRWNBRDMR3QjvXdCRchEX0O2ihFaTEqm0PTW5yLfKL4/edit?usp=sharing)
  - Green for added theory rules indicates that most common words (according to the COCA dataset) have been added
  - Additional theory rules without green highlight indicate that the incorporation of those rules are not complete, or are planned
