# warbler-dictionaries
My personal stenography dictionaries for use with Plover CAT software. Based off of Lapwing Theory and fully backward-compatible with Lapwing rules, with a few additional rules for briefs sprinkled on top of it. Adds a large amount of non-North American pronunciations / British pronunciations.
